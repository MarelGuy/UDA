                        The Request for Comment n. 1855(documenti standard informativi di internet)
                        With the term RFC 1855 we refer to a document that provides a minimum set of rules
                        and guidelines to be used while surfing the Internet or having access to it.
                        It has become known with the term of «Network Etiquette», or simply «Netiquette»
                        in short. This document is to be taken and adapted for the own use and needs
                        for companies and organizations, when it comes to their specific settings.
                        In short, the document is divided into 7 sections (or rather 6, plus an
                        introduction) and it addresses:
                    </p>
